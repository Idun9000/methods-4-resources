### Grid Approximation
```{r}
dist <- tibble(p_grid = seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = 20), # Building the grid 
               prior = rep(1, times = 20)) %>% # Setting the prior
              mutate(likelihood = dbinom(3, size = 4, prob = p_grid)) # Applying the likelihood functions to a cell in the grid

 dist <- dist %>% mutate(unstd_posterior = likelihood * prior)# Product of likelihood
   
   
dist <- dist %>% mutate(posterior = unstd_posterior / sum(unstd_posterior)) # Standardize posterior       
  
```
